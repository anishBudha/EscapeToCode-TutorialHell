# Analysis : Growth

> note: n is data size

- constant curve: y = 1
- logarithmic curve: y = logn
  > brinary search has logarithmic curve
- linear curve: y = n
  > linear search has linear curve
- loglinear curve: y = n log n
  > good sorting algorithms follow loglinear curve = quick sort, heap sort, merge sort
- Quadratic Curve: y = n^2
  > bad sorting algorithms follow quadratic curve = bubble sort, selection sort, insercetion sort
- Cubic Curve: y = n^3
- Exponential Curve: y = 2^n
  > Programs will be incredibely slow, good for program using very less data size
